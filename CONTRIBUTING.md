# Contributing to kubexns

:+1::tada: Thanks for taking the time to contribute! :tada::+1:

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to kubexns, 
which are hosted in the [Undistro Organization](https://github.com/undistro) on GitHub. 

## How Can I Contribute?

- **Giving us a star.** It may not seem like much, but it really makes a
  difference. This is something that everyone can do to help out kubexns.
  GitHub stars help the project gain visibility and stand out.

- **Reviewing the documentation.** 
  Most documentation just needs a review for proper spelling and grammar. 
  If you think a document can be improved in any way, 
  feel free to open a Pull Request with your suggestions.

- **Reporting bugs.** We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. 
  Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/undistro/kubexns/issues/new/choose).
  
- **Pull Request.** Unless you are fixing a known bug, we **strongly** 
  recommend discussing it with the core team via a GitHub issue before 
  getting started to ensure your work is consistent with kubexns's roadmap and architecture.
